## Flu Monitor
This project aim is to visualize the number of tweets that contain flu-related keywords with heatmaps (rather then markers).

Data is retrieved from http://www.flutrack.org/. Flutrack is getting this data by mining Twitter.

Twitter has been used as real time source for various public health applications. This amount of unsorted data, lead Flutrack team to the idea of creating a real time application that tracks the flu.

I believe that this kind of data is better visualized with heatmaps then markers. This is why I have created this small application.

Written in ES6 + React.
